CoreDataPro - CoreDataUtility
===============

CoreDataPro is an OSX application developed by mFluent LLC and is meant to simplifies the
development and debugging of CoreData enabled applications.
    
CoreDataPro is an application that was going to be sold in App Store but due to Apple's 
Sandbox limitations it would need to be changed in such ways that would make it almost 
useless.

This project was an internal tool. It was created because of the lack of good tools that 
make it easy to debug and develop applications that use Core Data. 

It lets you view explore your datamodel and view data that your application has stored.

In many ways CoreDataUtility is similar to CoreDataEditor.
